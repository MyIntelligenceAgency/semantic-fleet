    "# Notebook 04: Multi-Connector Optimization with Explicit Summarization Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we aim to demonstrate the power of multi-connector optimization. Specifically, we'll use a straightforward summarization prompt to show how the system can intelligently choose between different connectors (ChatGPT and Oobabooga models) based on performance metrics like speed and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Key**: Make sure you've run `00-AI-settings.ipynb` to set up your OpenAI key. We'll use ChatGPT as our primary connector.\n",
    "- **Oobabooga Model**: Make sure you have at least one Oobabooga model up and running. This model should be configured in the `Multiconnector` section of your `settings.json` file. The number of models you can run and their size will depend on your VRam capabilities. Suggestions are made in the multistart scripts and default settings.\n",
    "- **Prior Knowledge**: A basic understanding of the multi-connector pipeline is required. If you're new to this, consider going through `03-multiConnector-intro-with-arithmetic-mocks.ipynb` first."

They didn\\u2019t have to wait for letters anymore.\\n\\nThen, there was a thing called television. People could watch stories on it, like a play. They didn\\u2019t need to go outside.\\n\\nLastly, came mobile phones and computers. People could send messages fast. With the internet, they could also use something called social media to share stories with many people at once.\\n\\nSummary:\"\r\n",

Treat the following prompt as a function and provide a direct, precise completion without added commentary. Prioritize the most likely and salient function based on the information presented.
