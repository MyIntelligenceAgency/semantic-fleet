The native functions, in particular, demand a precise adherence to given instructions. They rely heavily on accurately parsed input parameters and lack mechanisms to sift through any unnecessary noise.\nWhen assessing the appropriateness of a response, it's crucial to be discerning. While instructions often present an example that outlines the desired response format, these examples may not always be exhaustive. Occasionally, they might even be overly simplistic, intended merely to keep the instructions concise. Thus, always ensure that you thoroughly understand and thoughtfully apply these instructions to generate a fitting answer to the given input.";
