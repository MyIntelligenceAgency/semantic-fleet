A long time ago, people wanted to tell others their stories. First, they wrote letters with their hands. They would send these letters to friends far away. Sometimes, people waited a lot of days to get a letter.

After that, a big machine called the printing press was made. It could make many copies of a story quickly. More people could read the same thing without waiting.

Next, there was a telephone. With it, people could talk and listen to friends who were far. They didn’t have to wait for letters anymore.

Then, there was a thing called television. People could watch stories on it, like a play. They didn’t need to go outside.

Lastly, came mobile phones and computers. People could send messages fast. With the internet, they could also use something called social media to share stories with many people at once.
