People have always loved to dance. Long ago, they jumped around fires, moving to the rhythms of drum beats. It was their way of having a party and sharing joy with others!

Later, big rooms called ballrooms appeared. Here, people danced gracefully while wearing fancy clothes. The rooms echoed with music from instruments like violins and flutes.

The twist came next. It was a fun dance where everyone wiggled their hips. No special clothes needed! Kids, adults, and even grandparents loved it and often danced together.

Then there was disco. People danced under shiny, bright lights in cool, glittering clothes. They moved to loud, catchy music and often danced until dawn.

Today, thanks to the internet, we see all kinds of dances. From cool moves in someone's room to traditional steps from different countries, dance keeps making us smile, laugh, and brings us closer together!
